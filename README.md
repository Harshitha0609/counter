## 🧠 About the Project

The **React Counter App** is built to showcase:
- How to manage state using **`useReducer`** instead of `useState`  
- Handling multiple actions (`Increment`, `Decrement`, `Reset`) in a **centralized reducer function**  
- A clean and responsive UI for user interaction  

This project is ideal for beginners learning **state management in React** and understanding how **reducers** simplify complex state updates.
